## Learning Objectives

* Learn about portlet actions and their effects on an application
* Explore the benefits of using tag libraries
* Understand the process of enabling validation in an application

## Tasks to Accomplish

* Create the Gradebook Web Module
* Implement the Main View
* Implement the Assignment Editing View
* Implement Validation

## Exercise Prerequisites

* Java JDK installed to run Liferay
    - Download here: [https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
    - Instructions on installation here: [https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml)
* Preferred development tools (e.g. Blade CLI, Gradle, IntelliJ IDEA with Liferay plugin, etc.) installed with the "Gradebook Workspace" already created
	- This was done in the first training module
* Exercise Prereqs added to workspace or previous training modules completed
