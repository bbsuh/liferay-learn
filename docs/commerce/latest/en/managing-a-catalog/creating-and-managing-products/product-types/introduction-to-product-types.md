# Introduction to Product Types

Commerce Catalogs provides three out-of-the-box Product types: Simple, Grouped, and Virtual.

**[Simple Product](./creating-a-simple-product.md)**: Any physical product for which inventory is tracked.

**[Grouped Product](./creating-a-grouped-product.md)**: Two or more Products from the Catalog that are packaged together and sold as a single item. Grouped Products are tracked in your inventory and can contain Simple Products, other Grouped Products, or Virtual Products.

**[Virtual Products](./creating-a-virtual-product.md)**: Any non-tangible Product, such as music files, electronic publications, services, and warranties.
